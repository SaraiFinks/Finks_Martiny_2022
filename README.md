Abstract: Plasmids are key mobile genetic elements in bacterial evolution and ecology
as they allow the rapid adaptation of bacteria under selective environmental
changes. However, the genetic information associated with plasmids is usually considered
separately from information about their environmental origin. To broadly understand
what kinds of traits may become mobilized by plasmids in different environments,
we analyzed the properties and accessory traits of 9,725 unique plasmid
sequences from a publicly available database with known bacterial hosts and isolation
sources. Although most plasmid research focuses on resistance traits, such genes
made up ,1% of the total genetic information carried by plasmids. Similar to traits
encoded on the bacterial chromosome, plasmid accessory trait compositions (including
general Clusters of Orthologous Genes [COG] functions, resistance genes, and carbon
and nitrogen genes) varied across seven broadly defined environment types
(human, animal, wastewater, plant, soil, marine, and freshwater). Despite their potential
for horizontal gene transfer, plasmid traits strongly varied with their hostâ€™s taxonomic
assignment. However, the trait differences across environments of broad COG categories
could not be entirely explained by plasmid host taxonomy, suggesting that environmental
selection acts on the plasmid traits themselves. Finally, some plasmid traits
and environments (e.g., resistance genes in human-related environments) were more
often associated with mobilizable plasmids (those having at least one detected relaxase)
than others. Overall, these findings underscore the high level of diversity of traits
encoded by plasmids and provide a baseline to investigate the potential of plasmids
to serve as reservoirs of adaptive traits for microbial communities.

Importance: Plasmids are well known for their role in the transmission of antibiotic
resistance-conferring genes. Beyond human and clinical settings, however, they disseminate
many other types of genes, including those that contribute to microbially
driven ecosystem processes. In this study, we identified the distribution of traits genetically
encoded by plasmids isolated from seven broadly categorized environments.
We find that plasmid trait content varied with both bacterial host taxonomy
and environment and that, on average, half of the plasmids were potentially mobilizable.
As anthropogenic activities impact ecosystems and the climate, investigating
and identifying the mechanisms of how microbial communities can adapt will be imperative
for predicting the impacts on ecosystem functioning.

This repository contains r scripts and packages used in the analysis described in the manuscript titled, "PPlasmid-Encoded Traits Vary across Environments". Additionally, PRIMER-e files having the PERMANOVA and statistical model used to disentangle the contribution of environment and host-phyla on variation of plasmid trait content are also included.
